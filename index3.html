          Earlier this month, Google released Gemini 2.0, ushering in the agentic era of AI. For many of our customers, they were
          already living it.
          
          Even before we released Gemini 1.0 a year ago, organizations of all sizes across all industries were already building AI
          services and early forms of agents on Vertex AI and tapping into generative tools in Google Workspace. During Google
          Cloud Next ‘24, we first published this post as a showcase for 101 of the best use cases out of hundreds featured across
          the event. Then in September, for our Gemini at Work event, we featured another 84 examples from our customers.
          
          Today, we’re rounding out a year truly defined by AI with more than 135 fresh examples. And in addition to grouping them
          by agent type, we’ve now broken them out by industry, as well — we keep hearing from customers just how important it is
          to see the opportunities in their field.
          
          What makes AI agents unique is that they can take actions to achieve specific goals, whether that’s guiding a shopper to
          the perfect pair of shoes, helping an employee looking for the right health benefits, or supporting nursing staff with
          smoother patient hand-offs during shifts changes.
          
          In our work with customers, we see their teams are increasingly focused on improving productivity, automating processes,
          and modernizing the customer experience. These aims are now being achieved through the AI agents they’re developing in
          six key areas: customer service; employee empowerment; code creation; data analysis; cybersecurity; and creative
          ideation and production.</p>
